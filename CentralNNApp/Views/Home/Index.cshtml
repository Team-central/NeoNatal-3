    <p class="about">About Neo+Natal.</p>
    <p class="aboutParagraph">
        NEO­+Natal is a new approach to combating high infant mortality in low resource Cleveland communities. A research team developed a unique risk profile for mothers based on publicly available demographic and geographic data correlated against clinical and medical research. From that data, the team developed a short questionnaire that could be used by community health workers to assess a mother's risk factors for having an infant fail to thrive past the first year of life.</p>
        <br />
    <p class="aboutParagraph2">The goal of the NEO+Natal Project is to curb infant mortality by using a new statistical tool, the @Html.ActionLink("Survey", "Survey", "Home"), to focus resources and interventions on the mothers with the highest risk factors.</p>

    <p class="project">Project Teams.</p>
    <p class="projectParagraph">Each team from the <a href="http://www.tri-c.edu/corporatecollege/professional-development/information-technology-training/cleveland-codes.html">Cleveland Codes Software Developer Academy at Tri-C</a> crafted a Neo+Natal tablet application that focused on a specific Cleveland neighborhood where infant mortality is high. The neighborhoods include:</p>
    <ul class="neighborhoods">
        <li>Buckeye</li>
        <li>@Html.ActionLink("Central", "Login", "Account", routeValues: null, htmlAttributes: new { id = "loginLink" })</li>
        <li>Clark-Fulton</li>
        <li>Fairfax</li>
